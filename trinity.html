<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu"><p>Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. (Continue here for more information about Trinity.)</p><br>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 15px 10px 10px;"><img src="Trinity University Murchison Tower Main.jpg" style="width:500px;height:333px"<br><br><p>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</p></div> <p> Trinity is a great university with a beautiful campus, great amenities and plenty of study spaces to hunker down in preparation for an exam. The culture around the university is also very close, as the smaller size of Trinity brings the student body into a pretty close-knit community, since there will almost always be someone around you know from one of your classes. Trinity has some amazing professors as well and a great business school, which I am personally interested in for my major.</p><br>
<p>My favorite aspects of Trinity revolve around the great atmosphere and caring staff who get to know each student on a pretty individualized level. I'll find myself walking around just to get a breath of fresh air out in the courtyard because the greenery, life (students and the occasional cat), and water fountain that sits amongst it all bring a great feeling of comfort.</p><br><br><br>

<p>I chose Trinity because I knew that a small, close knit community would be exactly what I needed to get myself started in college. As somewhat of an introvert with extroverted tendancies, it appealed to me that there would be plenty of people I would recognize, and it wouldn't be difficult to find someone to chat with over lunch.</p><br>
<p>I am thinking about majoring in Business Administration with a focus in management because I've always enjoyed working with people, particularly in problem solving, big picture ideas, and interpersonal communication. Here are some links to important information about my interest in Business Administration:</p><br>
